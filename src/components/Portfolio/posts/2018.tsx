            It was a project from the first semester of C# courses. The goal was
            to recreate the classic game 'Snake' in Windows Forms. The advanced
            level of this project was adding multiplayer features (using
            sockets).

            <I src={SnekMenu} /> In the menu you can choose your speed, color of
            your snake, color of the food, background color, and your nickname
            that will appear on the leaderboards. On the left you can see a
            live-preview of your settings.

            Just like in the original game there is normal food and special
            food, where normal food gives you points equal to your speed and
            special giving Ã—10 the speed. In addition, the special food
            disappears after some time (scaled to your speed). After consuming
            any food your snake grows larger. The goal is to survive as long as
            you can without running into your tail. After losing, the score,
            snake length, and chosen speed is saved to the leaderboards.

            Here you can see all records on your network. It displays some basic
            information of the game. (Leaderboards database is hosted by MySQL
            on my PC, so for now it doesnt work on other networks)

            Each player can either host or join a game, by entering a hosting
            number and your nickname. After that a lobby window pops up where
            you can see all players' nicknames in this room.

            It was a personal development project: learning more about how
            Artificial intelligence works. My goal was to fully understand and
            write code from the ground up without using existing libraries.
            Below you can find some projects I worked on using Machine Learning
            algorithms. <br />
            Disclaimer: graphs are only to explain the very basic idea.

            This algorithm focuses on perfecting something, just like in nature,
            we evolve and the fittest survives. Its comparable to how humans
            inherit features through genetics. In this example many 10PRINT
            designs are randomly created then after you chose your favorite 2,
            new ones are generated based on the previous bests.

            <I src={NNCarLaser} />
            This algorithm is the `brain`. Based on inputs it gives an output
            after processing the information. In this example I build in C# a
            program that first takes an image of a track to be created. Then
            from a given point cars are started and their goal is to go as far
            as possible. As shown on the picture, a car recieves distance
            inputs. It scans how far a wall is at all 8 directions and decides
            where to move next.

            <I src={NEGraph} />
            This algorithm merges the two previous ones. Now the `brain` gets
            better over time, the arrows here will represent the IQ level of a
            network. In this example I created a simulation of some balls trying
            to learn how to jump over the obstacles. Each of the 100 balls get
            the input of how far and how high is the obstacle, and how fast is
            it moving. Each of them have a unique set of arrows that help them
            decide whether they should jump or not. After all 100 balls are dead
            (hit a wall), a new, better generation of 100 new balls is made
            based & mutated off the best balls in the previous generation.

            This page was built on Node.js, giving me a lot of flexibility when
            handling http requests. Typed in URL is sent to the server. The
            server then strips down the URL and looks up in a database
            informations about it. After receiving data it is sent to a html
            renderer EJS that creates the HTML page. Once done it's sent to the
            user.

            The page is written in a clear and easy to read way, it helps in
            futher development. To some tiny extent the page was build following
            the MVC (model-view-controller) model.
